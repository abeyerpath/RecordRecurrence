RecordRecurrence
----------------

A resuable, Lighning first, and admin friendly UI for creating a series of object records based on date recurrences. Think a recurring calendar event (Monthly every 2nd Monday, etc...) but for creating a series of any standard/custom object.

* LEX native
* Lightning component usable as app page, quick action, flow... other places?

  * recurrence rules
  * field data
  * results preview
* Admin facing UI to specify:
  * "instances"
    * object
    * fields
    * where available
